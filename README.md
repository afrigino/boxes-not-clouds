# boxes-not-clouds
**A specification and manifesto for legible cyberinfrastructure.**

This repository defines principles and normative requirements for describing, operating, and governing digital infrastructure as bounded, inspectable systems (“boxes”) rather than mythic, opaque abstractions (“clouds”).

The goal is not to reject abstraction, but to constrain it so that claims about capability, security, intelligence, and neutrality survive audit, regulation, and democratic contestation.

---

## What This Is

- A **normative specification** (RFC-style) defining requirements for infrastructure legibility
- A **public manifesto** articulating the ethical and civic rationale
- A **versioned reference** intended for builders, auditors, policymakers, researchers, and institutions

This project treats infrastructure claims as engineering claims, not branding.

## Repository Structure
.
├── RFC-0001-Boxes-Not-Clouds.md # Normative specification (authoritative)
├── MANIFESTO.md # Readable companion text
├── CHANGELOG.md # Version history and revision policy
├── SIGNATORIES.md # Endorsers (guarded, non-authoritative)
└── SOURCES.md # Informative references

The RFC document is the **authoritative source**. Other documents are informative unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Status

- **RFC:** 0001
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Status:** Proposed
- **Initial publication:** 2026-01-05

Revisions follow semantic versioning and are logged publicly.

## Scope

This specification applies to infrastructure and services that materially shape:
- Data access and retention
- Decision-making affecting rights or life chances
- Long-term user dependency or lock-in

Examples include (but are not limited to): cloud platforms, AI services, financial and employment systems, health and education infrastructure.

---

## Non-Goals

This project does **not**:
- Define implementation details
- Mandate specific technologies
- Replace existing standards bodies
- Provide legal advice

It establishes **constraints on representation, governance, and accountability**, not architectures.

---

## How to Use This

- **Builders:** Use as a design and disclosure checklist
- **Auditors and regulators:** Use as a gap-analysis reference
- **Researchers:** Cite the RFC and track revisions
- **Institutions:** Adopt as a baseline transparency commitment

---

## Contributions

This repository is not open to casual pull requests.

Proposed changes should:
1. Open an issue describing the problem and rationale
2. Reference empirical evidence or architectural change
3. Preserve backward compatibility unless a major version bump is justified
