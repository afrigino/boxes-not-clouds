# Signatories

This document records endorsements of **RFC 0001: Boxes Not Clouds**.

Signing this document indicates agreement with the principles and normative requirements described in the RFC. Signatories do not gain governance authority, veto power, or editorial control by virtue of signing.

## What Signing Means

By signing, an individual or organization affirms that:

- They support describing digital infrastructure as bounded, inspectable systems.
- They reject deceptive abstraction, anthropomorphism, and ungrounded claims.
- They endorse portability, accountability, and contestability as baseline norms.

Signing does **not** imply:
- Full compliance in all current systems
- Legal certification
- Representation of other signatories
- Endorsement of unrelated views or projects

Attempts to use this list for marketing, authority laundering, or coercive signaling are grounds for removal.
