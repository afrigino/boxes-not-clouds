# Boxes Not Clouds  
## Manifesto for Legible Cyberinfrastructure

## 1. Grounded Descriptions

Services must describe themselves as engineered systems: hardware, software layers, operators, and constraints—not as magical, sentient, or boundless entities.

Every claim of capability (e.g., “smart,” “seamless,” “unlimited”) must link directly to measurable specifications such as uptime SLAs, error bounds, latency envelopes, or resource quotas.

---

## 2. Concrete Accountability

Providers must disclose physical and legal realities in layered formats:
- A one-page summary covering location, ownership, governing law, and jurisdiction.
- Expandable documentation covering infrastructure, power and network dependencies, data retention, and access controls.

Data flows must be mapped end-to-end: where bits reside, who can access them, under what automation or legal compulsion. These disclosures must be updated quarterly or upon material change.

---

## 3. Contracts, Not Vibes

Interfaces, marketing, and onboarding flows must not contradict formal terms of service, SLAs, or technical limits.

Claims such as “secure,” “anonymous,” or “private” may only be used when backed by explicit, auditable guarantees. Otherwise, they must not be used.

---

## 4. Explain Failure Like Adults

Outages, breaches, and model failures must be reported with clear causes, scope, impact, and remediation steps.

Euphemisms, minimization, or deflection are unacceptable.

For systems claiming to be critical or essential infrastructure, postmortems should be public by default.

---

## 5. Legible Architectures

Users must be able to see, at a human-readable level, the main system components:
- Storage
- Compute
- Models
- Key external dependencies

Dark patterns that hide data sharing, silent updates, or new monetization paths are unacceptable.

---

## 6. Data Dignity

No secondary use of data—training, profiling, resale, or enrichment—without informed, revocable consent.

Claims of anonymization must explicitly acknowledge re-identification risks and design accordingly.

---

## 7. Honest Intelligence

Systems marketed as “AI” or “autonomous” must disclose:
- Core capabilities and limits
- Training and update regimes
- Known failure modes and hallucination rates (where applicable)

Anthropomorphic interfaces are presumptively deceptive in infrastructure contexts and must be clearly labeled or avoided.

---

## 8. Portability Over Captivity

Users must be able to export data and configurations in open, documented formats.

Platforms that make exit practically impossible through technical, legal, or economic barriers are enclosures, not services.

---

## 9. Observability for the Governed

Infrastructure shaping life chances—credit, employment, health, housing, education, or law—must permit inspection, explanation, and contestation.

Black-box systems without recourse violate democratic norms.

---

## 10. Metaphor with Purpose

Clarifying metaphors are acceptable when they expose ownership, limits, and risk (e.g., “shared pool” for multiplexed resources).

Obscuring mythopoetry—metaphor that hides power, control, or responsibility—is prohibited.

---

## 11. Constructive Infrastructure

We support shared systems that deliver uptime, global access, and efficiency *when* governance is transparent and exit is feasible.

Abstraction is a tool for human ends, not an end in itself.

---

## 12. Governance Mechanisms

Truth in infrastructure requires institutions beyond individual choice.

Independent auditors, standards bodies, worker councils, civil society organizations, and regulators must be empowered to interpret and enforce these norms.

---

## 13. Revision and Accountability

This manifesto is revised periodically based on:
- New architectures
- Empirical evidence
- User, worker, and community feedback

Signers commit to public progress reports on adoption.

---

## 14. How We Intend to Act

**As builders**
- Default to interoperability
- Support self-hosting
- Publish reference implementations
- Maintain open documentation

**As users**
- Support audits and education
- Prefer cooperatives and public infrastructure
- Test claims rigorously
- Publicize successes and failures

**As institutions**
- Fund tooling for legibility (exporters, log viewers, decision tracers)
- Advocate portability and disclosure standards

**Collectively**
- Build alternatives—federated networks and public infrastructure—so demands are feasible, not utopian

---

## 15. The Pledge

> *We describe what we do in terms that survive court, regulation, and negotiation.  
> If our poetry cannot withstand specificity, we rewrite the poetry or the product—not user expectations.  
> We build as we demand.*
